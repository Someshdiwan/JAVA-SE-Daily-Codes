//Write a program which does the following:
//
//Create a variable n and store the user defined input from console in n.
//Output to the console the multiplication table for n up to 10:
//In the previous module we manually entered each row of the table.
//In this problem - use loops to generate the table.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class CodeChef1
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        // Update the blank given below.
        Scanner read = new Scanner(System.in);

        int n = read.nextInt();

        for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
        {
            System.out.println(n + " x " + i + " = " + n*i);
        }
    }
}

This line is printing the multiplication table. Here's how it works:

n is the number you input (e.g., 5).
i is the loop variable that goes from 1 to 10.
n + " x " + i + " = " + n*i is a string concatenation:
n is the number (e.g., 5).
        " x " is the string " x " (multiplication symbol).
i is the current loop value (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.).
        " = " is the string " = ".
n*i is the result of multiplying n by i.
        So, for example, when n = 5 and i = 2, the output will be:

        5 x 2 = 10
This is how the multiplication table is generated dynamically using the loop. Let me know if you need further clarification!

The + symbol in this context is used for string concatenation in Java. It combines strings and variables into a single string.

For example:

        System.out.println(n + " x " + i + " = " + n*i);
Hereâ€™s how it works step by step:

n is a variable (e.g., 5).
        " x " is a string literal (the text " x ").
i is another variable (e.g., 2).
        " = " is another string literal (the text " = ").
n*i is the result of multiplying n and i (e.g., 5 * 2 = 10).
When you use + between these, Java combines them into a single string:

n + " x " becomes "5 x ".
Then "5 x " + i becomes "5 x 2".
Then "5 x 2" + " = " becomes "5 x 2 = ".
Finally, "5 x 2 = " + (n*i) becomes "5 x 2 = 10"*/
