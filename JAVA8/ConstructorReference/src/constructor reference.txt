Your code demonstrates a constructor reference, which is a concise way to create new objects from a stream. 

Letâ€™s break down the key points and simplify the explanation:

What Is a Constructor Reference?

A constructor reference (using the ClassName::new syntax) is a shorthand notation in Java that tells the compiler to use a specific constructor. 

In your code, MobilePhone::new refers to the constructor of the MobilePhone class that accepts a String parameter.


This is equivalent to writing a lambda expression like this:

names.stream().map(name -> new MobilePhone(name))

But using MobilePhone::new is more concise and expressive.

Step-by-Step Explanation of Your Code

1. Creating a List of Names:

   List<String> names = Arrays.asList("A", "B", "C");
 
   This creates a list containing the strings "A", "B", and "C".

2. Creating a Stream and Mapping Each String to a MobilePhone:

   List<MobilePhone> mobilePhoneList = names.stream()
                                             .map(MobilePhone::new)
                                             .collect(Collectors.toList());
  
   -   names.stream(): Converts the list into a stream.
   -   .map(MobilePhone::new): For each name in the stream, the constructor reference MobilePhone::new is used to create a new MobilePhone object with that name.
   -   .collect(Collectors.toList()): Collects the resulting MobilePhone objects into a new list.

3. Printing the List:
  
   System.out.println(mobilePhoneList);
   
   This prints the list of MobilePhone objects. 
   However, without a custom toString() method in your MobilePhone class, you'll see the default object references (e.g., MobilePhone@1a2b3c).

Improving the Code for Better Output

To get a more readable output, override the toString() method in your MobilePhone class. Here's the updated code:

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

class MobilePhone {
    String name;

    public MobilePhone(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "MobilePhone{name='" + name + "'}";
    }
}

public class ConstructorReference {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // List of names
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("A", "B", "C");

        // Using a constructor reference to create MobilePhone objects
        List<MobilePhone> mobilePhoneList = names.stream()
                                                 .map(MobilePhone::new)
                                                 .collect(Collectors.toList());

        // Print the list of MobilePhone objects
        System.out.println(mobilePhoneList);
    }
}
```
Expected Output:

[MobilePhone{name='A'}, MobilePhone{name='B'}, MobilePhone{name='C'}]


Recap:

- Constructor Reference (MobilePhone::new):  
  Simplifies object creation by directly referencing the constructor.
  
- Stream Mapping:  
  Transforms a list of strings into a list of MobilePhone objects.
  
- Overriding toString():  
  Provides a meaningful string representation when printing objects.
