The load factor is a measure that determines how full a hash table
(like Java’s HashMap) is allowed to get before its capacity is automatically increased.

It is defined as the ratio of the number of stored entries to the total capacity of the table.

For example, a load factor of 0.75 means that when the hash table is 75% full,
it will resize (typically doubling its capacity) to maintain efficient performance
and reduce the likelihood of collisions.

Balancing the load factor is important because:
- A lower load factor decreases the chance of collisions but increases memory usage.
- A higher load factor uses memory more efficiently but may lead to more collisions and slower performance.
