Additional Important Methods:

Functional-Style Updates (Java 8+):

compute(K key, BiFunction remappingFunction):
Updates the mapping for the given key using its current value (or null if absent). If the function returns null, the key is removed.

computeIfAbsent(K key, Function mappingFunction):
Inserts a mapping only if the key is absent or mapped to null. Ideal for lazy initialization.

computeIfPresent(K key, BiFunction remappingFunction):
Updates the mapping only if the key is already associated with a non-null value.

merge(K key, V value, BiFunction remappingFunction):
Combines an existing value with a new value. If the key isn’t already present, it simply inserts the provided value; otherwise, it computes a new value.

Use case: Combining or accumulating values.

Bulk and Conditional Operations:

replace(K key, V value) and replace(K key, V oldValue, V newValue):
Replace the value for a key, optionally checking if the current value matches an expected value.

replaceAll(BiFunction function):
Applies a transformation function to every mapping in the map, replacing the existing value with the function’s result.
forEach(BiConsumer action):

Iterates through each key-value pair in the map, allowing you to perform an action on every entry.

Clone:

clone():
Creates a shallow copy of the HashMap, meaning that the keys and values are not deep-copied.

Interview Perspectives

Thread Safety and Concurrency:

Non-synchronized Nature:

HashMap is not thread-safe. If multiple threads modify the map concurrently (without proper synchronization),
unexpected behavior can occur.

Alternatives for Concurrency:

When thread safety is required, consider using ConcurrentHashMap or wrapping the HashMap with Collections.synchronizedMap.

Fail-Fast Iterators:

Definition and Behavior:
The iterators for HashMap’s collection views (e.g., keySet, entrySet) are fail-fast.
If the map is structurally modified (other than through the iterator's own remove method) during iteration,
a ConcurrentModificationException is thrown.

Interview Tip:

Be prepared to explain why fail-fast behavior is useful for detecting concurrent modification bugs rather than ensuring safe concurrency.

Hash Function and Collision Handling:

Importance of a Good hashCode():

The performance of HashMap depends on how well keys are distributed among buckets. Poorly implemented hash functions can lead to excessive collisions.

Collision Resolution:
Initially, collisions are handled using linked lists. Since Java 8, when the number of collisions in a bucket exceeds a threshold,
the bucket is converted into a balanced tree, enhancing worst-case performance.

Discussion Point:
Expect questions on why a good hash function is crucial and how collision handling impacts performance.


Capacity, Load Factor, and Rehashing:

Initial Capacity and Load Factor:
These parameters determine when rehashing occurs. The default load factor (0.75) is a compromise between time and space efficiency.

Rehashing Mechanics:
When the number of entries exceeds (capacity × load factor), the internal data structure is rebuilt (rehashing) with an increased number of buckets.

Interview Insight:
You may be asked to discuss the trade-offs in choosing initial capacity and load factor, especially in scenarios with a known number of elements.

Null Keys and Values:

Null Handling:
HashMap permits one null key and multiple null values, which differentiates it from legacy classes like Hashtable.

Interview Angle:
Be ready to contrast HashMap with other Map implementations (e.g., Hashtable, TreeMap) regarding null support and ordering.
Shallow Copy vs. Deep Copy:


Cloning:
The clone method provides a shallow copy. In an interview, you might need to explain the difference and
implications of shallow versus deep copying, especially when mutable objects are involved.

Memory Considerations:

Bucket Overhead:
The internal structure (array of buckets) may have memory implications if the initial capacity is set too high.

Interview Consideration:
Be prepared to discuss how improper sizing can lead to wasted memory or performance hits due to rehashing.
Final Interview Preparation Tips

Practical Use Cases:
Understand scenarios where you’d choose HashMap over other implementations (e.g., when order is not important, and you need fast lookups).

Code Examples:
Review code snippets that utilize advanced methods like computeIfAbsent for caching or memoization, and practice writing thread-safe modifications.

Conceptual Questions:
Prepare to explain internal workings, such as how the hashCode of an object influences bucket placement, and what happens during rehashing.

Comparative Analysis:
Be ready to compare HashMap with other map implementations like TreeMap (ordered by keys) and ConcurrentHashMap (for thread safety).
