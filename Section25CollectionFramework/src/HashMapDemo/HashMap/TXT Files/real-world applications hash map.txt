n real-world applications, you typically won't write your own HashMap from scratch because modern
languages like Java, Python, and C++ provide highly optimized, built-in hash-based data structures (e.g., Java’s `HashMap`, Python’s `dict`, or C++’s `unordered_map`).


However, the underlying concepts are widely used across many areas:

Where Hash Tables (and by extension, HashMaps) Are Used

- **Backend Systems:**
  - **Caching:** To quickly store and retrieve session data, configuration settings, or frequently accessed results.
  - **Data Storage:** Often used for managing in-memory data stores, such as lookup tables for user data, configurations, or permissions.
  - **Microservices:** Many backend services rely on hash maps for fast access to data when handling API requests or processing business logic.

- **Database Systems:**
  - **Indexing:** Databases use hash indexes for fast lookup of records.
  - **Query Processing:** Techniques like hash joins in SQL databases use hash tables to efficiently combine large datasets.

- **Algorithmic and Data Processing Tasks:**
  - **Counting/Grouping:** Hash maps are key to many algorithms, for example, counting word frequencies in text processing or grouping elements based on attributes.
  - **Lookups:** They enable constant-time complexity (on average) for inserting, deleting, and accessing data, which is crucial in performance-critical applications.

- **Frontend Applications:**
  - **JavaScript Maps/Objects:** While the frontend typically uses simpler built-in structures (like JavaScript objects or the `Map` class), the underlying idea is similar—storing key-value pairs for tasks like caching or managing state.

### **Why Understand Custom Implementations?**

- **Educational Value:**  
  Building a custom HashMap helps you understand collision resolution, dynamic resizing, and the importance of correctly implementing methods like `hashCode()` and `equals()` (in Java) for object keys.
  
- **Insight into Performance:**  
  Knowing how these data structures work can help you make better decisions when optimizing applications, especially when dealing with large datasets or high-throughput systems.

- **Design of Frameworks and Libraries:**  
  Many libraries, frameworks, and even parts of database systems rely on hash tables internally. Understanding these basics allows you to appreciate the engineering behind these tools.

### **Summary**

- **Backend and Databases:**  
  Hash maps are heavily used in backend systems for caching, indexing, and fast lookups, as well as in databases for indexing and query optimizations.

- **Frontend:**  
  Similar concepts exist (e.g., JavaScript objects or Maps), but you'll rarely implement your own hash table in frontend code.

- **Custom Implementations:**  
  They’re mostly used for learning and understanding rather than for production code since built-in implementations are robust and optimized.

By grasping how a custom HashMap works, you gain valuable insight into a foundational data structure that's at the heart of many high-performance systems across both backend and database technologies.
