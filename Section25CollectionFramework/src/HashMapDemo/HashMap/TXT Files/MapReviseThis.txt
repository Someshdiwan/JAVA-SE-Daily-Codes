### Map Interface vs. HashMap Implementation

| Feature               | Map Interface ?                                            | HashMap Implementation ?                                                                          |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   Type                | An interface that defines the contract for key-value maps. | A concrete class that implements the Map interface using a hash table.                            |
|   Instantiation       | Cannot be instantiated directly.                           | Can be directly instantiated using new HashMap<>().                                               |
|   Method Definitions  | Only contains abstract method signatures.                  | Provides complete implementations for all Map operations.                                         |
|   Null Handling       | Behavior depends on the implementation.                    | Allows one null key and multiple null values.                                                     |
|   Ordering            | No ordering is enforced by the interface.                  | Unordered – no guarantee on the order of keys or values.                                          |
|   Performance         | N/A – acts as a blueprint for implementations.             | Offers constant-time (O(1) on average) performance for basic operations under ideal conditions.   |

### Differences Between TreeMap and HashMap

| Feature               | TreeMap ?                                                                                           | HashMap ?                                                                               |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   Ordering            | Maintains keys in sorted order (either natural order or via a custom Comparator).                   | Does not maintain any order; entries are stored in an unordered manner.                 |
|   Implementation      | Uses a Red-Black Tree (a self-balancing binary search tree).                                        |  Uses a hash table with a hashing mechanism.                                            |
|   Performance         | Operations such as  put(), get(), and remove() take O(log n) time.                                  | Provides O(1) average time for basic operations like put(), get(), and remove().        |
|   Null Keys           | Does NOT allow null keys (although multiple null values are allowed).                               | Allows one null key along with multiple null values.                                    |
|   Best Use Case       | Ideal for scenarios requiring sorted data retrieval and navigable operations (e.g., range queries). | Best for situations needing fast lookups and insertions where ordering isn’t important. |
|   Memory Usage        | Uses more memory due to the overhead of maintaining a tree structure.                               | More memory efficient as it only stores hash-based mappings.                            |
|   Iterator Behavior   | Iterates in ascending (sorted) key order.                                                           | Iterates in an unpredictable, unordered order.                                          |

Use HashMap when:
- Fast lookups, insertions, and deletions are required.
- The order of elements is not important.

Use TreeMap when:
- You need the keys to be maintained in a sorted order.
- You require additional navigable methods such as higherKey(), lowerKey(), ceilingKey(), or floorKey().

HashMap Example (Unordered):

import java.util.HashMap;

public class HashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashMap<Integer, String> hashMap = new HashMap<>();
        hashMap.put(3, "C");
        hashMap.put(1, "A");
        hashMap.put(2, "B");

        System.out.println(hashMap); // Output may vary, e.g., {3=C, 1=A, 2=B}
    }
}


TreeMap Example (Sorted Order):

import java.util.TreeMap;

public class TreeMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TreeMap<Integer, String> treeMap = new TreeMap<>();
        treeMap.put(3, "C");
        treeMap.put(1, "A");
        treeMap.put(2, "B");

        System.out.println(treeMap); // Output: {1=A, 2=B, 3=C} (Sorted Order)
    }
}

### Final Takeaway

- Map Interface vs. HashMap:
  The Map interface provides the blueprint, while HashMap is a popular concrete implementation known for its efficient, hash-based storage and retrieval.

- TreeMap vs. HashMap:
  Choose TreeMap when you need sorted keys and navigable operations, and HashMap when you prioritize performance with fast access and do not care about ordering.
