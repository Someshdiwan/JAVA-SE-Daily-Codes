Comparison: HashMap vs Hashtable vs ConcurrentHashMap 🚀

| Feature               | `HashMap` 🟢 | `Hashtable` 🔵 | `ConcurrentHashMap` 🔴 |
|----------------------|------------|------------|------------------|
| **Thread-Safe?**     | ❌ No      | ✅ Yes (fully synchronized) | ✅ Yes (better performance) |
| **Synchronization Level** | ❌ Not synchronized | 🔒 Whole map (method-level sync) | 🔒 Partial map (bucket-level sync) |
| **Performance (Multi-threaded)** | ⚡ Fast (Single-threaded) | 🐢 Slow (Full lock) | ⚡⚡ Faster (Fine-grained locking) |
| **Null Keys Allowed?** | ✅ Yes (one) | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (one) |
| **Null Values Allowed?** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Best Use Case** | Single-threaded apps | Legacy synchronized apps | High-concurrency apps |

### **Key Differences Explained**
1. **`HashMap`**  
   - **Not thread-safe** but great for single-threaded apps.
   - Allows **one `null` key** and multiple `null` values.
   - **Faster** because it doesn’t have synchronization overhead.

2. **`Hashtable`**  
   - **Thread-safe** but **slow** due to method-level synchronization.
   - **No `null` keys/values** allowed.
   - **Legacy class**; rarely used in modern applications.

3. **`ConcurrentHashMap`**  
   - **Best for multi-threading** as it locks only specific parts of the map (**bucket-level locking**).
   - Allows **one `null` key** and multiple `null` values.
   - Much **faster than `Hashtable`** in concurrent environments.

### **Which One Should You Use?**
- ✅ **Single-threaded app?** → **Use `HashMap`**
- ✅ **Multi-threaded app?** → **Use `ConcurrentHashMap`**
- ❌ **Don't use `Hashtable`** unless working with old legacy code.
